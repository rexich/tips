# My tips and manuals on using specific software

This repository contains useful tips and manuals that describe usage of
certain software, as well as tips on avoiding pitfalls and bugs, solving
a program's issues, and so on.

Knowledge is to be shared, so I freely share it to everyone, in hope of
helping the world become a better place and helping others. Feel free to
